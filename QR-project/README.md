## What I learned
Through this challenge, I practiced creating a simple card layout centered both vertically and horizontally. I also experimented with CSS properties like border-radius, box-shadow, and object-fit for image styling.

<body>
  <div class="white_box">
    <div class="blue_box">
      <img src="./images/QR.png" alt="" class="imgqr">
    </div>
    <div class="text_1">
      Improve your front-end skills by building projects
    </div>
    <div class="text_2">
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
    </div>
  </div>
</body>

  background-color: white;
    width: 90%;              
    max-width: 20em;
    height: 31.19em;
    border-radius: 0.9em;
    padding: 1.2em;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);

    Continued development
I want to continue improving my CSS layout skills, especially with Grid and Flexbox combinations, and work more on accessibility features and semantic markup.
