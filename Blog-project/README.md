My Process
Built With
Semantic HTML5

CSS Flexbox

Custom properties (CSS variables)

Mobile-first approach

What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of layout techniques, especially using Flexbox for card alignment and spacing. I also practiced clean semantic HTML and learned the importance of detail in pixel-perfect UIs.

Example snippet:

css
Copy
Edit
.avatar_div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.75rem;
}
Continued Development
I’d like to improve:

Better responsiveness for edge cases

Integrating accessibility best practices for screen readers

Exploring animation or hover effects with @keyframes or :hover
